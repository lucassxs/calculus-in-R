# Calculus in R - MAT150

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains my annotations and exercise resolutions from
the MAT150 Coursebook [Start R in
Calculus](https://webwork.collegeofidaho.edu/MAT150Resources/StartR-August-2012.pdf)
of [The College of Idaho](https://www.collegeofidaho.edu/).

The package used in this repository and in the exercise resolutions is
[Mosaic: Project MOSAIC Statistics and Mathematics Teaching
Utilities](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic/index.html).

> The {mosaic} package for R which supports teaching stats using a
> expressive, compact, and consistent formula syntax. This minimizes
> start up costs for students and enables students to calculate
> descriptive statistics, create statistical graphics, and construct
> statistical graphics. {mosaic} is one of three main syntaxes for
> teaching and doing statistics using R.
